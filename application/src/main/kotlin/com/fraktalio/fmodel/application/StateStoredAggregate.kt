/**
 * State stored aggregate is using/delegating a [StateStoredAggregate.decider] of type [Decider]<[C], [S], [E]> to handle commands and produce new state.
 * In order to handle the command, aggregate needs to fetch the current state via [StateRepository.fetchState] function first, and then delegate the command to the [StateStoredAggregate.decider] which can produce new state as a result.
 * If the [StateStoredAggregate.decider] is combined out of many deciders via `combine` function, an optional [StateStoredAggregate.saga] could be used to react on new events and send new commands to the [StateStoredAggregate.decider] recursively, in one transaction.
 * New state is then stored via [StateRepository.save] suspending function.
 *
 * [StateStoredAggregate] implements an interface [StateRepository] by delegating all of its public members to a specified object.
 * The Delegation pattern has proven to be a good alternative to implementation inheritance, and Kotlin supports it natively requiring zero boilerplate code.
 *
 * @param C Commands of type [C] that this aggregate can handle
 * @param S Aggregate state of type [S]
 * @param E Events of type [E] that are used internally to build/fold new state
 * @property decider A decider component of type [Decider]<[C], [S], [E]>.
 * @property stateRepository Interface for [S]tate management/persistence - dependencies by delegation
 * @property saga A saga component of type [Saga]<[E], [C]>
 * @constructor Creates [StateStoredAggregate]
