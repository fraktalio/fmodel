/**
 * Event sourcing aggregate is using/delegating a `decider` of type [IDecider]<[C], [S], [E]> to handle commands and produce events.
 * In order to handle the command, aggregate needs to fetch the current state (represented as a sequence of events) via [EventRepository.fetchEvents] function, and then delegate the command to the `decider` which can produce new event(s) as a result.
 * Produced events are then stored via [EventRepository.save] suspending function.
 *
 * [EventSourcingAggregate] extends [IDecider] and [EventRepository] interfaces,
