/**
 *
 * Event sourcing aggregate is using/delegating a [EventSourcingAggregate.decider] of type [Decider]<[C], [S], [E]> to handle commands and produce events.
 * In order to handle the command, aggregate needs to fetch the current state (represented as a list of events) via [EventRepository.fetchEvents] function, and then delegate the command to the [EventSourcingAggregate.decider] which can produce new event(s) as a result.
 * If the [EventSourcingAggregate.decider] is combined out of many deciders via `combine` function, an optional [EventSourcingAggregate.saga] could be used to react on new events and send new commands to the [EventSourcingAggregate.decider] recursively, in one transaction.
 * Produced events are then stored via [EventRepository.save] suspending function.
 *
 * [EventSourcingAggregate] implements an interface [EventRepository] by delegating all of its public members to a specified object.
 * The Delegation pattern has proven to be a good alternative to implementation inheritance, and Kotlin supports it natively requiring zero boilerplate code.
 *
