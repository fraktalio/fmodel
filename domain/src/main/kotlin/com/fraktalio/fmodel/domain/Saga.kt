 * [_Saga] is a datatype that represents the central point of control deciding what to execute next ([A]).
 * It is responsible for mapping different events from aggregates into action results ([AR]) that the [_Saga] then can use to calculate the next actions ([A]) to be mapped to commands of other aggregates.
 *
 * The biggest difference between `Saga` and `Process` is that `Saga` is stateless, it does not maintain the state.
 *
 * @param AR Action Result type
 * @param A Action type
 * @property react A pure function/lambda that takes input state of type [AR], and returns the list of actions [Sequence]<[A]>.
 * @constructor Creates [_Saga]
